Which of the following sequence of documents represents a standard order-to-cash process in SAP S/4HANA?,multiple-choice,A. Inquiry → Quotation → Billing document → Sales order → Outbound delivery, ,B. Quotation → Inquiry → Sales order → Outbound delivery, ,C. Inquiry → Quotation → Sales order → Outbound delivery, ,D. Sales order → Post goods issue → Outbound delivery → Billing document, , , , , ,3, You cannot create a billing document before a sales order. Therefore  answer A is incorrect. You can create a quotation after an inquiry but not the other way around  which invalidates answer B. Post goods issue is always performed after the outbound delivery is created; thus  answer D is also incorrect. Only answer C remains as the correct answer  which is in line with the diagram shown earlier in Figure 9.1., 
Which of the following are key features of the SAP Fiori factsheet app Sales Quotations? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. Display schedule lines details for each of the items, ,B. Navigate to the Customer – 360° View app, ,C. Display relevant key facts of the preceding inquiry, ,D. Display relevant key facts of the quotation, , , , , ,2*4, The SAP Fiori factsheet app Sales Quotations does not display information at the schedule line level  nor does it show key facts of the preceding inquiry. The key facts displayed at the top of the screen always belong to the actual quotation selected. Therefore  answers A and C are both incorrect  leaving us with B and D as the only two correct answers to this question., 
Which of the following statements are correct regarding alternative items in sales?,multiple-choice,A. Alternative items can only be used in inquiries., ,B. Alternative items can only be used in quotations., ,C. Alternative items can only be used in sales orders., ,D. Alternative items can be used in both inquiries and quotations., , , , , ,4, You can offer your customer optional alternative materials by entering them directly below the item requested in both inquiries and quotations., 
In a sales order with three items (items 10  20  and 30)  payment terms CP00 have been copied from the customer master into the order header  as well as into all three items in the order. The user manually changes the payment terms for item 20 to R001 and saves the order. What would happen if another user subsequently changes the payment terms at the header level to TCPT?,multiple-choice,A. The payment terms are updated to TCPT on all items., ,B. The payment terms are updated to TCPT on items 10 and 30 only., ,C. The payment terms are updated to TCPT on item 20 only., ,D. The payment terms are changed at the header level  but none of the items are updated., , , , , ,2, The payment terms are an example of a general business data field. Thus  the value entered at the header is automatically copied to all items. However  if you manually change the payment terms for item 20 from CP00 to R001  the item will be included in the own business data item list  shown earlier in Figure 9.6. As a consequence  if you then change the payment terms at the header level from CP00 to TCPT  item 20 won’t be updated. Items 10 and 30 will be automatically updated as they don’t show up in the own business data list. Answer B is  therefore  the only correct answer., 
Which of the following data is proposed from the business partner master record of the ship-to party during sales order creation? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. Incoterms, ,B. Tax, ,C. Shipping conditions, ,D. Ship-to address, ,E. Delivering plant, , , ,2*4*5, The data proposed from the ship-to party during sales order creation is the tax classification  the ship-to address  and the delivering plant., 
Which of the following data is proposed from the business partner master record of the sold-to party during sales order creation? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. Delivering plant, ,B. Incoterms, ,C. Order reason, ,D. Shipping conditions, , , , , ,2*4, The data proposed from the sold-to party during sales order creation is the Incoterms and the shipping conditions., 
Which master record has priority in terms of delivering plant determination in a sales order item?,multiple-choice,A. Material master record, ,B. Business partner master record (sold-to), ,C. Business partner master record (ship-to), ,D. Customer-material information record, , , , , ,4, The sequence of master data objects used by the system to determine the delivering plant in a sales order item is: 1. Customer-material information record 2. Customer master record of the ship-to (assuming the material is maintained in the concerned plant) 3. Material master record The customer-material information record always takes priority; thus  answer D is the correct answer to this question., 
Which of the following fields are used during automatic shipping point determination in a sales order item? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. Shipping type, ,B. Delivery priority, ,C. Shipping condition, ,D. Loading group, ,E. Plant, , , ,3*4*5, Shipping point determination is carried out for all relevant items based on the shipping condition at the header level  the loading group maintained in the material master record  and the plant in the sales order item., 
Which of the following elements can influence the route determination for a sales document item? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. Material freight group, ,B. Shipping conditions, ,C. Unloading point, ,D. Transportation group, , , , , ,2*4, As shown earlier in Figure 9.7  the shipping condition in the header of the sales document and the transportation group maintained in the material master record are two fields used during route determination., 
True or False: If a rejection reason is selected for a sales document item  the reference status of the item is automatically set to Fully Referenced  and the item cannot be copied.,multiple-choice,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. Indeed  a rejected item cannot be copied  but the reference status of the item is not controlled by the rejection reason. The reference status is automatically set when the entire quantity has been copied or based on the completion rule defined for the item category. Question In the standard system  a quotation has been created for 5 units with reference to an inquiry. The total quantity in the inquiry item is 30  and no other subsequent documents exist. Which is the correct reference status value for the inquiry item? A. Fully Referenced B. Not Referenced, ,C. Partially Referenced, ,D. Open, , , , , ,1, In the standard system  item categories for inquiries have been set up so the item reference status is set to Fully Referenced after the first reference and regardless of the quantity in the target sales document item. Therefore  answer A is the only correct answer to this question., 
True or False: In the standard cash sales process  both a delivery and a billing document are automatically generated when the sales order is posted  and a cash invoice is printed immediately from the billing document.,multi-select,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. In the standard cash sales process shown earlier in Figure 9.9  an outbound delivery is automatically generated when the sales order is posted. The billing document is created later  usually via a periodic batch job. Also  the cash sale invoice is an output generated from the sales order  not from the billing document. Question Which of the following are characteristics of a rush order transaction? (There are two correct answers.) A. The customer orders  picks up  and pays for the goods immediately. B. The system automatically creates a delivery when the order is saved., ,C. A customer invoice is automatically printed when the order is saved., ,D. The goods are picked up by the customer or delivered to the customer the same day the order is placed. Payment takes place later., , , , , ,2*4, In a rush order scenario  the customer does not pay for the goods immediately. Both the billing document and the output are generated after the delivery of the goods depending on the payment terms negotiated with the customer. Billing happens usually through a periodic batch job. However  as soon as the sales order is saved  an outbound delivery is automatically created. Only answers B and D describe characteristics of the rush order process. This special sales process is illustrated in the diagram shown earlier in Figure 9.10., 
Which of the following statements describe the make-to-order sales process in SAP S/4HANA? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. You must use special item categories for controlling make-to-order production., ,B. Produced materials are received into consignment stock., ,C. The plant must be populated on the sales order item., ,D. The transfer of requirements to production planning is controlled by the strategy group in the material master record., , , , , ,3*4, In SAP S/4HANA  the item category no longer takes priority when controlling the requirements type. The system first tries to find a requirements type using the strategy group in the material master  and if the strategy group has not been maintained  the system will use the MRP group. Thus  answer A is incorrect. In a make-to-order production scenario  produced materials are received in sales order-specific stock (special stock indicator E). Consignment stock (special stock indicator W) is not used in make-to-order production  making answer B a false statement. Therefore  the only two correct answers are answers C and D., 
In a third-party order process  what customizing setting in SAP S/4HANA Sales controls whether the invoice receipt quantity or the quantity of goods received is relevant for billing?,multiple-choice,A. The copy control sales document to billing document at the schedule line level, ,B. The copy control sales document to billing document at the item level, ,C. The copy control delivery document to billing document at the item level, ,D. The definition of the sales document item category, , , , , ,2, The quantity used on the billing document item in a third-party order process (item categories such as TAS or CB1) is controlled by the Billing Quantity field in the copy control for sales document to billing document at the item level. For example  for item category CB1 the Billing Quantity indicator has been set to E; thus  the billing quantity is calculated as the goods receipt quantity minus the invoiced quantity. For item category TAS  however  this indicator is set to F meaning that the billing quantity  in this case  is calculated as the invoice receipt quantity minus the invoiced quantity., 
Which of the following documents used in complaints processing must be created with reference to an invoice?,multiple-choice,A. Returns order, ,B. Free-of-charge subsequent delivery, ,C. Credit memo request, ,D. Invoice correction request, , , , , ,4, In the diagram shown earlier in Figure 9.20  an invoice correction request can only be created with reference to an invoice. This limitation exists because standard sales document type RK (Invoice Correction Request) has been defined with the value M in the Reference mandatory field  meaning any invoice correction request must be created with reference to a billing document., 
True or False: Although it is not recommended by SAP  you can create independent free-of-charge subsequent deliveries using standard sales document type SD.,multi-select,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. Standard sales document type SD (free-of-charge subsequent delivery) has been defined with value C in the Reference mandatory field  meaning any free-of-charge subsequent delivery can only be created with reference to a sales order. An example of a free-of-charge subsequent delivery created with reference to a returns order is represented in the diagram shown earlier in Figure 9.17. Question Which of the following ways of creating outbound deliveries are supported in SAP S/4HANA? (There are three correct answers.) A. Without any reference B. With reference to a billing document, ,C. With reference to a sales order, ,D. With reference to a stock transport order, ,E. With reference to a shipment document, , , ,1*3*4, In SAP S/4HANA  depending on how the delivery type is configured  you can create deliveries without any reference using the SAP GUI Transaction VL01NO or the SAP Fiori app Create Outbound Delivery – Without Order Reference. You can also create deliveries with reference to sales orders and stock transport orders. However  you cannot create deliveries with reference to billing documents  which is a subsequent document that is only generated after a goods issue is posted for the outbound delivery. Shipments documents are used in transportation planning  and you can assign deliveries to them  but both deliveries and shipment documents are created independently of one another., 
True or False: Unlike a sales order  an outbound delivery does not contain any data at the schedule line level.,multi-select,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:A Explanation: True. The structure of the delivery is divided into data at the header level and at the item level. No schedule lines exist in the delivery. However  schedule line information is available in the sales order and is used to create the delivery document. Question Which of the following fields are only found in the header of the delivery document? (There are two correct answers.) A. Plant B. Shipping point, ,C. Ship-to party number, ,D. Reference document number, , , , , ,2*3, Each delivery is always created for a single shipping point and is delivered to a single address; thus  both the shipping point and the ship-to party are found at the header level. The delivering plant is maintained at the item level  as shown earlier in Figure 10.1  since you can assign the same shipping point to multiple plants. The preceding document is also stored at the item level since SAP S/4HANA allows you to combine several sales orders into a single delivery., 
You must ensure that an outbound delivery will determine a picking storage location. What controls this functionality?,multiple-choice,A. The delivery schedule line category, ,B. The delivery type, ,C. The delivery item category, ,D. The material master record, , , , , ,3, The Determine Storage Location checkbox in the delivery item category  shown earlier in Figure 10.3  controls whether the system automatically determines a storage location for the delivery item., 
Which of the following settings can be configured in the definition of a delivery item category? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. Whether the delivery item must meet the minimum quantity maintained in the material master or customermaterial record, ,B. Whether the item is relevant for billing, ,C. Whether an availability check must be carried out for the item, ,D. Whether partial deliveries are allowed, , , , , ,1*3, The Billing Relevance field controls whether an item is relevant for billing. However  this field is not found in the definition of the delivery item category but rather in the definition of the sales document item category. The Complete Delivery indicator is maintained in the customer master record and is copied into the header of the sales document. Therefore  answers B and D are both incorrect  thus leaving only answers A and C as the only two correct answers to this question., 
Which of the following elements can be used to influence the determination of the delivery item category? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. Shipping point, ,B. Item usage, ,C. Item category group, ,D. Route, ,E. Delivery type, , , ,2*3*5, As shown earlier in Figure 10.4  the delivery type  the material item category group  and the item usage are fields used in the determination of the delivery item category. The shipping point and the route are important fields in delivery processing and transportation scheduling but have nothing to do with item category determination., 
Which of the following functions are controlled by the delivery type? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. The delivery is relevant for picking., ,B. A credit limit check must be performed., ,C. A sales order is required as a basis for delivery., ,D. The rule for determining the storage location for picking., , , , , ,3*4, The Order Required field in the definition of the delivery type controls whether a preceding document is required and  if so  the type of preceding document. When configuring the delivery type  you can also use the Storage Location Rule field to specify how the system determines the picking location when a delivery is created if a storage location has not been maintained in the sales order item. These two fields are shown earlier in Figure 10.2. Picking relevance is defined at the delivery item level  and the credit management functions are activated for the sales document item category; thus  both A and B are incorrect answers., 
True or False: Item category determination is not carried out if the outbound delivery is created with reference to a sales order.,multi-select,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:A Explanation: True. When an outbound delivery is created with reference to a sales order  the item category in the sales order item is automatically copied into the corresponding delivery item. No item category determination is carried out for the delivery item in this scenario. Question A customer requests that two orders be combined into a single delivery. Which of the following sales order fields must have the same value to fulfill the criteria for order combination? (There are three correct answers.) A. Storage location B. Route, ,C. Incoterms, ,D. Ship-to party, ,E. Division, , , ,2*3*4, The three fields that must have the same value in the sales document items to meet the criteria for order combination are the route  the Incoterms  and the ship-to party. These three fields are found in the delivery header  so inconsistent values in any of these fields would automatically result in a delivery split. Storage location and division are  however  part of the delivery item data., 
True or False: If needed  you can manually override both the route and/or the shipping point determined by the system in the delivery.,multi-select,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. In a delivery document  you can manually override the route but not the shipping point. The shipping point is not an editable field in any delivery document. Question Which of the following are characteristics of the route determination functionality in SAP S/4HANA? (There are three correct answers.) A. The system prompts you to redetermine the route for each item if the ship-to party changes in the order. B. The system prompts you to redetermine the route for each item if the shipping condition changes in the order., ,C. The system prompts you to redetermine the route for the item if the quantity changes in the order., ,D. The delivery item category controls whether the route must be redetermined when an outbound delivery is created., ,E. Route determination can be carried out with or without weight group., , , ,1*2*5, The country and transportation zone of the ship-to party and the shipping condition are factors that influence the route determination  so if either the ship-to party or the shipping condition in the order changes  the system will ask you whether you want to redetermine routes and shipping for all items. Route determination can also be carried out with or without considering the weight group but depends on which document is used as the base to determine the route. If the route is determined in the sales order  the weight group is not taken into account (shown earlier in Figure 10.8). Whereas if the route is determined in the delivery  the weight group is part of the search criteria (shown earlier in Figure 10.9)., 
Which of the following factors is a prerequisite for the automatic determination of the picking location in the delivery item? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. A picking rule has been assigned to the delivery type., ,B. The automatic determination of storage location has been activated for the delivery type., ,C. The delivery item category must be relevant for picking., ,D. The storage location has been assigned to a warehouse number., , , , , ,1*3, To activate the automatic determination of the picking location in the delivery document  you must assign a picking rule (e.g.  MALA) in the definition of the delivery type and configure the delivery item category as relevant for picking. Answer B is incorrect since the Determine Storage Location checkbox is not maintained for the delivery type but instead defined in the delivery item category. Answer D is also wrong since the assignment of a storage location to a warehouse number does not affect the determination of the picking location., 
Which of the following elements can be used to determine the loading time in delivery scheduling? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. Transportation group, ,B. Route, ,C. Weight group, ,D. Loading group, ,E. Shipping point, , , ,2*4*5, As shown earlier in Figure 10.11  the determination of the loading time in delivery scheduling can be influenced by the shipping point  the route  and the loading group. The transportation group and the weight group are two factors that are never part of the search criteria to determine the loading time., 
During backward scheduling  which of the following times are always determined using the route? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. Transit time, ,B. Total replenishment lead time, ,C. Loading time, ,D. Transportation lead time, , , , , ,1*4, The total replenishment lead time is maintained in the material master record (MRP 3 view) and is thus not influenced by the route  so answer B is incorrect. The loading time can be determined using the route (route-dependent loading time) or without the route (route-independent loading time) depending on the option selected in the Determine Loading Time field for the shipping point  as shown earlier in Figure 10.15. Therefore  answer C is not correct  thus leaving only answers A and D as the only two correct answers. Both the transportation lead time and the transit time are specified in the definition of the route  as shown earlier in Figure 10.7., 
Which of the following functions are carried out on the basis of the goods issue document? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. Overall status for picking is updated., ,B. The document flow is updated., ,C. The warehouse or plant stock is increased by the delivery quantity., ,D. Delivery requirements in materials planning are reduced by the delivery quantity, , , , , ,2*4, The overall picking status is updated when the picking is carried out and not at post goods issue; thus  answer A is not correct. Once the goods issue is posted for a delivery  the plant stock is decreased by the delivery quantity. By definition  performing the post goods issue cannot increase the plant stock  which invalidates answer C. Posting a goods issue causes the system to update the document flow and reduce delivery requirements in materials planning  among other functions. Therefore  answers B and D are the only two correct answers to this question., 
Which of the following are characteristics of the billing document in SAP S/4HANA? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. It contains data at the item level., ,B. It contains data at the schedule line level., ,C. It can be created without reference to a preceding document., ,D. The billing date is only found in the document’s header., , , , , ,1*4, All billing documents must always be created with reference to a preceding document  which can be either a sales document  delivery  or another billing document. Therefore  answer C is not correct. Also  the structure of a billing document matches the structure of the delivery document since it only contains data at the header and item level. No schedule lines exist in a billing document since the goods have been delivered and/or the services provided by the time the billing document is created. Thus  answer B is invalid  which leaves you with answers A and D as the only two correct answers to this question., 
True or False. You cannot assign an external number range to a billing document.,multi-select,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:A Explanation: True. As shown earlier in Figure 11.3  you can only define an internal number range for billing documents. External number ranges are not allowed to ensure the billing document numbers are unique and consecutive. Question Which of the following customizing activities for billing documents are available in the IMG menu? (There are three correct answers.) A. Define billing item categories B. Define billing types, ,C. Define item category determination in billing documents, ,D. Assign invoice list type to each billing type, ,E. Maintain copying control for billing documents, , , ,2*4*5, In SAP S/4HANA  all billing documents are created with reference  and the item category in the preceding document is always copied into the billing document item. As a result  no item category determination is carried out during billing; therefore  you won’t find customizing tasks to define or assign item categories for billing documents in the IMG menu. Thus  both answers A and C are invalid  leaving you with answers B  D  and E as the only three correct answers to this question., 
Which of the following parameters are available when configuring billing document types in SAP S/4HANA? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. Transaction group, ,B. Incompleteness procedure, ,C. Billing type for cancellation, ,D. Posting block, ,E. Billing block, , , ,1*3*4, As shown earlier in Figure 11.3  for a given billing document type  you can maintain a transaction group  maintain a billing type for cancellation  and activate a posting block  among other parameters. These three settings are mentioned in answers A  C  and D  respectively. You cannot define an incompleteness procedure or a billing block for billing document types  so answers B and E are both incorrect., 
True or False. At the time of billing document creation  the billing type is always defaulted based on the billing type associated with a specific sales document type and cannot be manually changed.,multi-select,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. The system automatically proposes a billing type based on the default billing type assigned to the reference document. However  if needed  you can manually change the proposed billing type to another valid billing type. The billing document types allowed are defined in the copy control from sales documents and delivery documents to billing documents. For example  for a given delivery document type LF  you can create a customer invoice (billing type F2) or a pro forma invoice (billing type F8). Question Which of the following are valid document flows when creating a billing document? (There are two correct answers.) A. Invoice → Delivery → Debit memo B. Credit memo request → Credit memo → Invoice, ,C. Order → Invoice → Credit memo, ,D. Delivery → Invoice, , , , , ,3*4, Answer A is not correct because you cannot create a delivery with reference to an invoice; in fact  the opposite is true. Also  debit memos are created with reference to debit memo requests and not from a delivery document. Regarding answer B  you cannot create a customer invoice from a credit memo in the standard system. Therefore  answer B is also incorrect  which leaves you with answers C and D as the only two valid document flows out of the four options provided., 
Which of the following are characteristics of the SAP GUI Transaction VF04 or the equivalent SAP Fiori app Create Billing Documents – VF04? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. You can display a detailed log for the collective run., ,B. You can process the billing due list as a simulation “trial run.”, ,C. You can switch on/off the billing setting Automatically post billing documents., ,D. It is not possible to perform a split analysis., , , , , ,1*2, In Transaction VF40 or the Create Billing Documents – VF04 app  you can generate multiple billing documents by processing the billing due list. In this transaction  you can display a detailed log for the collective run as well as process the billing due list in simulation mode. So  answers A and B are both correct. You can also perform a split analysis  as shown earlier in Figure 11.14 which invalidates answer D. Finally  answer C is also incorrect since the billing setting Automatically post billing documents is available in the Create Billing Documents app but not in Transaction VF04 or in the Create Billing Documents – VF04 app., 
In terms of billing split or convergence  which of the following variables can influence the outcome of a collective billing run when processing multiple billable reference documents? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. Discrepancies in split-relevant fields at the header or item level, ,B. A custom pricing requirement assigned to condition PPR0, ,C. The billing setting Automatically post billing documents in the Create Billing Documents app, ,D. A custom data transfer routine in the copying control for billing documents, , , , , ,1*4, Answer A is correct because any discrepancies in split-relevant fields at the header or item level will obviously cause an invoice split. We also mentioned that you can use the data transfer routine VBRK/VBRP in the copy control for billing documents to implement additional split criteria based on your customer requirements. For example  your company may want to split an invoice if the ship-to party in two or more reference documents differs. This scenario is not supported by the standard configuration  but it can be achieved via custom data transfer routines in the copying control. Answer D is  therefore  the second of the only two correct answers to this question., 
True or False: During collective billing  different customer reference numbers (field VBKD-BSTKD) in two sales orders always cause a billing document split  despite all the other splitrelevant fields having identical values.,multi-select,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. As mentioned in this chapter  the customer reference number is stored in field VBKD-BSTKD in the sales document and field VBRK-BSTNK_VF in the billing document. This field constitutes a special case and does not always cause a billing document split  which is the reason why it has not been included in the list of fields that form the standard split criteria shown earlier in Table 11.5. The customer reference number will cause a billing document split only if you maintain the Reference Number parameter with value A in the copy control for billing documents at the header level. But if the Reference Number parameter is blank in the copy control for billing documents  you can combine two sales documents with two different customer reference numbers (field VBKD-BSTKD) in one billing document since the field VBRK-BSTNK_VF will be blank. Question Which standard fields always cause a billing document split when populated with differing values? (There are two correct answers.) A. Distribution channel B. Bill-to party, ,C. Total net value, ,D. Ship-to party, , , , , ,1*2, As shown earlier in Table 11.5  both the distribution channel and the bill-to party are part of the standard split criteria  which means that if the values between two or more reference documents differ  they always cause a billing document split. We strongly recommend you familiarize yourself with the list of fields that form the standard split criteria. Answers A and B are  therefore  the only two correct answers to this question., 
Which of the following statements regarding preliminary billing documents are true? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. They can be changed as often as necessary., ,B. To use them  you need to activate the corresponding business function in customizing., ,C. They are available from SAP S/4HANA 1909., ,D. They can be posted to financial accounting., ,E. A preliminary billing document is an optional predecessor to the final billing document., , , ,1*2*5, Preliminary billing documents are a new function available SAP S/4HANA 2020 (software component S4CORE from release 105); thus  answer C is incorrect. Also  as discussed earlier  preliminary billing documents are optional documents that are not relevant for posting to financial accounting. Thus  answer D is invalid  which leaves you with answers A  B  and E as the only three correct answers to this question., 
You’ve been asked to set up the system so that invoices are created based on the completion of specific stages of a project. Which functionality supports this business requirement?,multiple-choice,A. Preliminary billing documents, ,B. Milestone billing plans, ,C. Periodic billing plans, ,D. Invoice lists, , , , , ,2, The milestone billing plan is the functionality available in the standard system for managing the creation of billing documents based on milestones that mark the completion of specific stages of a project., 
True or False. SAP S/4HANA allows you to process down payments on the basis of either periodic or milestone billing plans in sales orders.,multi-select,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. In SAP S/4HANA  down payments can only be processed on the basis of either milestone billing plans or document conditions in sales orders. You cannot process down payments with periodic billing plans. Question Which of the following are characteristics of an invoice list in the standard system? (There are two correct answers.) A. It can contain single or collective billing documents. B. A single invoice list can contain invoices  credit memos  and debit memos., ,C. It only contains billing documents with a common bill-to party., ,D. It only contains billing documents that have already been released to financial accounting., , , , , ,1*4, In the standard system  invoice lists for credit memos use billing type LG  whereas invoice lists for invoices and debit memos use billing type LR. As a result  invoices  debit memos  and credit memos cannot be combined in the same invoice list since the invoice list types are different. Thus  answer B is invalid. Answer C is also incorrect since you can combine several billing documents with different bill-to parties in the same invoice list  as long as they all have the same payer. Therefore  answers A and D are the only two correct answers to this question., 
Which of the following parameters are used by the system to perform account determination when a billing document is transferred to financial accounting? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. Account assignment group of the ship-to party, ,B. Account key, ,C. Sales organization, ,D. Profit center in the material master record, ,E. Account assignment group of the material, , , ,2*3*5, The account key  sales organization  and account assignment group of the material are three of the billing document-related parameters used by the system to determine the correct general ledger accounts and create the journal entry. Thus  answers B  C  and E are all correct answers. The account assignment group of the payer is also used in account determination but not the account assignment group of the ship-to party. Finally  the profit center in the material master record is not a parameter used in account determination either. Therefore  answers A and D are both incorrect answers., 
Which of the following is the purpose of the simplification list?,multiple-choice,A. To show a list of transactions that are no longer used, ,B. To show a list of tasks needed for conversion from SAP ERP 6.0 to SAP S/4HANA, ,C. To show a list of technical and business impacts that can be expected with an upgrade to that specific version of SAP S/4HANA, ,D. To run a consistency check to run against your existing system to see what needs to change before upgrading to SAP S/4HANA., , , , , ,3, The simplification list is designed to identify specific impacts when upgrading to that version of SAP S/4HANA. These impacts can be business or technical  both of which are highlighted within the list. The simplification list is not designed to give you advice on conversion activities or how to run consistency checks for the purposes of conversion  although these tasks are mentioned where appropriate. Furthermore  the simplification list will not show you the transactions that have been made obsolete in SAP S/4HANA. Information is available in the SAP library for these requirements but is not included in the simplification list., 
Which of the following are simplification items that should be considered when moving to an SAP S/4HANA environment from an SAP ERP 6.0 environment? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. The SAP ERP SD foreign trade functionality has now been absorbed into the Materials Management (MM) module., ,B. SD rebates have been replaced by settlement management., ,C. Output management in SAP S/4HANA Sales is performed  by default  via BRFplus instead of the previous NAST-based approach., ,D. The ATP check has been enriched in SAP S/4HANA to include SAP S/4HANA for advanced ATP capabilities., ,E. The standard sales tables VBAK and VBAP do not need to be used anymore in SAP S/4HANA., , , ,2*3*4, Understanding simplification items is important. From the list given  the only correct answers are that SD rebates have been replaced by settlement management  output management is now handled by default by BRFplus  and the ATP check can now include advanced ATP. The answer options illustrate the need to read a question thoroughly before answering. For example  answer E mentions the standard tables VBAK and VBAP as not being used anymore—this statement is correct if we’re talking about tables VBUK and VBUP  but not tables VBAK and VBAP!, 
Your client asks you why they should implement business partners in their SAP S/4HANA project. Which of the following statements would you mention? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. Business partners are mandatory in SAP S/4HANA  and customers can no longer be created in transactions such as Transaction XD01., ,B. The business partner approach means we no longer need to think about partner functions such as sold-to party  ship-to party  bill-to party  and payer., ,C. The unified architecture of business partners means one data object can serve multiple roles., ,D. The business partner approach means that SAP S/4HANA conforms to the same architecture as other SAP products in the landscape., ,E. Every SAP user in the system has their own business partner record  thus improving transparency and visibility., , , ,1*3*4, The business partner methodology is the only way to create customers and vendors in SAP S/4HANA. This change brings SAP S/4HANA in line with other SAP applications such as SAP CRM  that already use business partners. Note that some of the functionality around customers remains the same—such as the concepts of partner functions like sold-to  ship-to  etc. Nevertheless  the use of business partners allows a single data object to take on multiple roles in the system. SAP user records are a completely separate data object in SAP S/4HANA., 
Which of the following statements is true about traditional customer master transactions  such as Transactions XD01 and VD01  in SAP S/4HANA:,multi-select,A. Attempting to use the transactions will redirect you to Transaction BP., ,B. Transactions are still available but are not recommended for use., ,C. Transactions have disappeared entirely and will not be recognized if used. Correct Answer:A Explanation: Obsolete transactions related to customer and vendor master records will now redirect you to the unified Transaction BP via a dialog message. As such  the transactions still exist  but only as a pointer to the correct transaction. Question The CVI functionality can be used to perform which of the following activities? A. Set up the system so that all business partner data is stored in the BUT* tables without the need to copy to tables KNA1 and KNVV B. Ensure that  once business partners are created  the data is filtered down to the customer and vendor tables C. Set up a connection between customers and vendors so that any data added to the vendor master data object can be selectively copied to the customer master data object Correct Answer:B Explanation: CVI exists so that there is a permanent link between a business partner and the customer or vendor tables  such as tables KNA1 and LFA1. Once the SAP S/4HANA system is established  business partner data is saved in the BUT* tables  but if the business partner is extended to the role “customer” then the data will be copied to all the customer master tables  such as tables KNA1 and KNVV. Question When converting from SAP ERP 6.0 to SAP S/4HANA  several steps are required in order to convert customers and vendors to business partners. Which of the following steps are required? (There are two correct answers.) A. Implement CVI in your SAP ERP 6.0 system B. Stop all users from creating customers using Transaction XD01 in your SAP ERP 6.0 system using security authorizations C. Convert existing customers and vendors to business partners in your SAP ERP 6.0 system, ,D. Create a Legacy System Migration Workbench (LSMW) migration script to convert the customers and vendors in your SAP ERP 6.0 system to business partners in your SAP S/4HANA system, , , , , ,1*3, Conversion from SAP ERP 6.0 to SAP S/4HANA involves some preparation work in both the source and the target system. In your SAP ERP 6.0 system  you must activate CVI in the direction of customer to business partner and convert all your customers and vendors to business partners. Your users can continue to create customers in the normal way using Transaction XD01.When you’re ready to execute the conversion scripts  your SAP ERP 6.0 system will have business partners already created and ready for conversion., 
Settlement management in SAP S/4HANA replaces SD rebates. What does this mean for the sales data model?,multi-select,A. The SD rebate type field has been extended from 1 character to 3 characters., ,B. Table VBOX is now redundant., ,C. Table VBOX can still be used but must be manually activated. Correct Answer:B Explanation: Within the SD rebates functionality  table VBOX was a real problem for performance  with hundreds of thousands (and in many cases  millions) of data records housed in the table. Due to the power of the SAP HANA database  such index tables are no longer required  and table VBOX is therefore completely redundant in SAP S/4HANA. Question The BRFplus approach to outputs does come with a few limitations. Which of these limitations are true? (There are two correct answers.) A. Only business partners can be used for communication purposes. B. IDocs cannot be used at all by BRFplus. C. ALE is not supported by BRFplus., ,D. BRFplus is only available for sales outputs  and therefore  outputs for POs cannot be used., , , , , ,1*3, Although the BRFplus functionality is quite powerful and flexible  its scope is limited by a number of factors. One factor is the requirement that outputs can only be communicated with business partners (meaning logical systems cannot be used)  and another is that ALE system-to-system connections are not supported by BRFplus. IDocs can be used by BRFplus within these limitations  and outputs for BRFplus can be used for any business scenarios that were previously supported by NAST  including POs., 
True or False: The BRFplus approach to SD output management is mandatory in SAP S/4HANA.,multi-select,A. True, ,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. While it is true that the BRFplus approach to sales and distribution outputs is the default approach in SAP S/4HANA  this functionality can be switched off  meaning that sales and distribution outputs can revert back to the NAST methodology. Question Which of the following are the attributes of BRFplus decision tables? (There are two correct answers.) A. Multiple condition columns are allowed but only one result column. B. Rows in the decision table are read sequentially from top to bottom., ,C. When setting up the decision table  each step must be activated before it can be used., ,D. Master data value updates in the decision tables in BRFplus must always be transported through the development system to the production landscape., , , , , ,2*3, BRFplus decision tables act a lot like condition tables for NASTbased outputs  but with a few differences. Similar to NAST condition tables  BRFplus decision tables are read sequentially from top to bottom when the system attempts to determine a result. When adding data in the decision table  each step must be activated before it can be used. The table is made up of multiple condition columns  but unlike condition tables  it is also made up of multiple results columns  allowing full flexibility. Updates of the master data in the decision tables are carried out in Transaction OPD and do not need to be transported., 
Which of the following attributes are true for the SAP S/4HANA credit management approach to customer credit limits? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. Credit limits can be calculated using a predefined and customizable formula., ,B. Credit limits for customers are maintained using Transaction FD32., ,C. Customer credit limits can be calculated dynamically or set as a static value., ,D. Customer credit limits can be activated by sales document type and/or by item category., ,E. By default  customer credit limits are set by the integration with the Credit Rules Engine., , , ,1*3*4, Credit limits in SAP S/4HANA financial supply chain management can be managed in a number of different ways. The first is to set a static credit limit against the business partner master record. However  you can also direct the system to calculate the credit limit from a customizable formula. The determination of the method used is carried out in the business partner transaction  Transaction BP. (Transaction FD32 is obsolete.) As with SAP ERP 6.0  credit limits in SAP S/4HANA can be activated by sales document type and by item category in the IMG. Additional options are available for automatic calculation of credit limits  calculations of risk class  and internal scoring  which are available as part of the Credit Rules Engine  but this solution is an additional licensed option and not a standard feature., 
Settlement management has replaced the old SD rebates functionality in SAP S/4HANA  and rebates are now more flexible due to some of these changes. Regarding the difference between sales and materials management condition contracts in SAP S/4HANA  which of the following statements is true?,multi-select,A. Sales and materials management rebates can now be defined using the same functionality., ,B. Materials management rebates must now be defined and maintained in SAP Ariba., ,C. Rebates are processed in SAP Fiori and cannot be maintained in SAP GUI. Correct Answer:A Explanation: The beauty of settlement management in SAP S/4HANA is that it harmonizes both sales and materials management functionality in the same area. As a result  condition contracts can be set up in the core system of SAP S/4HANA for customers and vendors alike. SAP Fiori apps are available for creating condition contracts  as are SAP GUI transactions (Transaction WCOCO). Question Where is the data formerly housed in the SAP ERP SD foreign trade functionality now found? A. Smart business embedded analytics apps in SAP Fiori B. SAP GTS C. SAP Analytics Cloud Correct Answer:B Explanation: The old concept of data in the SAP ERP SD foreign trade functionality is obsolete in SAP S/4HANA. While some of this data has been moved to SAP S/4HANA for international trade  the recommended approach for SAP ERP SD foreign trade functions is to use SAP GTS. Question SAP S/4HANA for international trade provides which of the following functions as standard  with no need for any additional licensing? (There are three correct answers.) A. SAP Watch List Screening B. Material classifications  such as commodity codes and intrastat service codes C. License control and embargoes, ,D. Standard airway bill forms, ,E. Intrastat declarations, , , ,2*3*5, Trade compliance functions are available in the core SAP S/4HANA system by using SAP S/4HANA for international trade functions. These functions cover material classifications  such as the allocation of commodity codes and intrastat service codes; legal control through the definition and maintenance of export licenses; restrictions on exports to countries under embargo; and intrastat declarations. The functionality also includes denied party screening through SAP Watch List Screening  but this capability requires an additional license., 
The sales data model in SAP S/4HANA has been simplified in which of the following ways? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. Index tables are no longer needed due to the advanced processing power of the SAP HANA database., ,B. Index tables are no longer in the sales area but have been moved into SAP BTP to optimize performance., ,C. The status tables VBUK and VBUP have been moved into tables VBAK and VBAP., ,D. The status tables VBUK and VBUP do not exist in SAP S/4HANA., , , , , ,1*3, The power of the SAP HANA database has allowed some essential streamlining of the overall data model in SAP S/4HANA Sales. The key tables that have been rendered obsolete are the index tables and the status tables. Index tables have been completely removed and are not required anywhere in the SAP S/4HANA landscape. For status tables  such as tables VBUK and VBUP  these tables still exist in the system  but the status fields have been replicated in tables VBAK and VBAP for ease of use. It is important to note that tables VBUK and VBUP are still available and can be populated by activating standard function modules in the system., 
The new pricing table PRCD_ELEMENTS has replaced table KONV in SAP S/4HANA  thus providing greater flexibility which of the following ways? (There are two correct answers.),multi-select,A. All pricing master data previously found in the “A” prefixed tables is now found in table PRCD_ELEMENTS., ,B. Table PRCD_ELEMENTS now allows pricing to be passed freely to the business warehouse without any additional coding required., ,C. Table PRCD_ELEMENTS is a transparent table rather than a cluster table., ,D. Field lengths for key fields in the table have been lengthened., , , , , ,3*4, Table KONV in SAP ERP 6.0 was a cluster table  which meant that it was always difficult to select from using joins. Furthermore  data was restricted due to field length in the table. SAP S/4HANA has addressed both of these concerns by creating table PRCD_ELEMENTS  which is a transparent table rather than a cluster table  increasing ease of use. Additionally  the field lengths for some key fields in the table have been extended  meaning additional functionality has been opened for use. All pricing tables prefixed with “A” remain the same as in SAP ERP 6.0., 
A conversion from SAP ERP 6.0 to SAP S/4HANA requires which of the following steps to be undertaken? (There are three correct answers.),multi-select,A. During the implementation project  customers in the SAP ERP 6.0 system must be set up as business partners using Transaction BP., ,B. You must use BRFplus as the new output management approach in SAP S/4HANA., ,C. Any SD rebates must be created in SAP S/4HANA as condition contracts., ,D. Customers and vendors must be converted to business partners., ,E. Credit management functionality must be moved to the financial supply chain management model., , , ,3*4*5, The conversion process from SAP ERP 6.0 to SAP S/4HANA requires that the CVI process for business partners is set up in the source system and that conversion from customers and vendors takes place in the source system. However  the business practice of creating customers and vendors in the traditional Transactions XD01 and XK01 can continue in the source system until the target SAP S/4HANA data migration is completed. The output management option using BRFplus is optional  not mandatory  because the NAST approach is still available for use in SAP S/4HANA. Rebates and credit management must change  however  with rebates moving to settlement management because condition contract and credit management functions have moved to the financial supply chain management module.,
