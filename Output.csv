False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. Indeed, a rejected item cannot be copied, but the reference status of the item is not controlled by the rejection reason. The reference status is automatically set when the entire quantity has been copied or based on the completion rule defined for the item category. Question In the standard system, a quotation has been created for 5 units with reference to an inquiry. The total quantity in the inquiry item is 30, and no other subsequent documents exist. Which is the correct reference status value for the inquiry item? A. Fully Referenced B. Not Referenced,C. Partially Referenced,D. Open,,,A,
True or False: In the standard cash sales process, both a delivery and a billing document are automatically generated when the sales order is posted, and a cash invoice is printed immediately from the billing document.,A. True,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. In the standard cash sales process shown earlier in Figure 9.9, an outbound delivery is automatically generated when the sales order is posted. The billing document is created later, usually via a periodic batch job. Also, the cash sale invoice is an output generated from the sales order, not from the billing document.

Which of the following documents used in complaints processing must be created with reference to an invoice?,A. Returns order,B. Free-of-charge subsequent delivery,C. Credit memo request,D. Invoice correction request,,,D,
True or False: Although it is not recommended by SAP, you can create independent free-of-charge subsequent deliveries using standard sales document type SD.,A. True,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. Standard sales document type SD (free-of-charge subsequent delivery) has been defined with value C in the Reference mandatory field, meaning any free-of-charge subsequent delivery can only be created with reference to a sales order. An example of a free-of-charge subsequent delivery created with reference to a returns order is represented in the diagram shown earlier in Figure 9.17. Question Which of the following ways of creating outbound deliveries are supported in SAP S/4HANA? (There are three correct answers.) A. Without any reference B. With reference to a billing document,C. With reference to a sales order,D. With reference to a stock transport order,E. With reference to a shipment document,,ACD,
True or False: Unlike a sales order, an outbound delivery does not contain any data at the schedule line level.,A. True,B. False Correct Answer:A Explanation: True. The structure of the delivery is divided into data at the header level and at the item level. No schedule lines exist in the delivery. However, schedule line information is available in the sales order and is used to create the delivery document.

A sales order is required as a basis for delivery.,D. The rule for determining the storage location for picking.,,,CD,
True or False: Item category determination is not carried out if the outbound delivery is created with reference to a sales order.,A. True,B. False Correct Answer:A Explanation: True. When an outbound delivery is created with reference to a sales order, the item category in the sales order item is automatically copied into the corresponding delivery item. No item category determination is carried out for the delivery item in this scenario. Question A customer requests that two orders be combined into a single delivery. Which of the following sales order fields must have the same value to fulfill the criteria for order combination? (There are three correct answers.) A. Storage location B. Route,C. Incoterms,D. Ship-to party,E. Division,,BCD,
True or False: If needed, you can manually override both the route and/or the shipping point determined by the system in the delivery.,A. True,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. In a delivery document, you can manually override the route but not the shipping point. The shipping point is not an editable field in any delivery document. Question Which of the following are characteristics of the route determination functionality in SAP S/4HANA? (There are three correct answers.) A.

Which of the following are characteristics of the billing document in SAP S/4HANA? (There are two correct answers.),A. It contains data at the item level.,B. It contains data at the schedule line level.,C. It can be created without reference to a preceding document.,D. The billing date is only found in the document’s header.,,,AD,
True or False. You cannot assign an external number range to a billing document.,A. True,B. False Correct Answer:A Explanation: True. As shown earlier in Figure 11.3, you can only define an internal number range for billing documents. External number ranges are not allowed to ensure the billing document numbers are unique and consecutive.

True or False. At the time of billing document creation, the billing type is always defaulted based on the billing type associated with a specific sales document type and cannot be manually changed.,A. True,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. The system automatically proposes a billing type based on the default billing type assigned to the reference document. However, if needed, you can manually change the proposed billing type to another valid billing type. The billing document types allowed are defined in the copy control from sales documents and delivery documents to billing documents. For example, for a given delivery document type LF, you can create a customer invoice (billing type F2) or a pro forma invoice (billing type F8). Question Which of the following are valid document flows when creating a billing document? (There are two correct answers.) A. Invoice → Delivery → Debit memo B. Credit memo request → Credit memo → Invoice,C. Order → Invoice → Credit memo,D. Delivery → Invoice,,,CD,

The billing setting Automatically post billing documents in the Create Billing Documents app,D. A custom data transfer routine in the copying control for billing documents,,,AD,
True or False: During collective billing, different customer reference numbers (field VBKD-BSTKD) in two sales orders always cause a billing document split, despite all the other splitrelevant fields having identical values.,A. True,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. As mentioned in this chapter, the customer reference number is stored in field VBKD-BSTKD in the sales document and field VBRK-BSTNK_VF in the billing document. This field constitutes a special case and does not always cause a billing document split, which is the reason why it has not been included in the list of fields that form the standard split criteria shown earlier in Table 11.5. The customer reference number will cause a billing document split only if you maintain the Reference Number parameter with value A in the copy control for billing documents at the header level. But if the Reference Number parameter is blank in the copy control for billing documents, you can combine two sales documents with two different customer reference numbers (field VBKD-BSTKD) in one billing document since the field VBRK-BSTNK_VF will be blank. Question Which standard fields always cause a billing document split when populated with differing values? (There are two correct answers.) A. Distribution channel B. Bill-to party,C. Total net value,D. Ship-to party,,,AB,

True or False. SAP S/4HANA allows you to process down payments on the basis of either periodic or milestone billing plans in sales orders.,A. True,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. In SAP S/4HANA, down payments can only be processed on the basis of either milestone billing plans or document conditions in sales orders. You cannot process down payments with periodic billing plans. Question Which of the following are characteristics of an invoice list in the standard system? (There are two correct answers.) A. It can contain single or collective billing documents. B. A single invoice list can contain invoices, credit memos, and debit memos.,C.

Your client asks you why they should implement business partners in their SAP S/4HANA project. Which of the following statements would you mention? (There are three correct answers.),A. Business partners are mandatory in SAP S/4HANA, and customers can no longer be created in transactions such as Transaction XD01.,B. The business partner approach means we no longer need to think about partner functions such as sold-to party, ship-to party, bill-to party, and payer.,C. The unified architecture of business partners means one data object can serve multiple roles.,D. The business partner approach means that SAP S/4HANA conforms to the same architecture as other SAP products in the landscape.,E. Every SAP user in the system has their own business partner record, thus improving transparency and visibility.,,ACD,
Which of the following statements is true about traditional customer master transactions, such as Transactions XD01 and VD01, in SAP S/4HANA:,A. Attempting to use the transactions will redirect you to Transaction BP.,B. Transactions are still available but are not recommended for use.,C. Transactions have disappeared entirely and will not be recognized if used. Correct Answer:A Explanation: Obsolete transactions related to customer and vendor master records will now redirect you to the unified Transaction BP via a dialog message. As such, the transactions still exist, but only as a pointer to the correct transaction. Question The CVI functionality can be used to perform which of the following activities? A. Set up the system so that all business partner data is stored in the BUT* tables without the need to copy to tables KNA1 and KNVV B. Ensure that, once business partners are created, the data is filtered down to the customer and vendor tables C. Set up a connection between customers and vendors so that any data added to the vendor master data object can be selectively copied to the customer master data object Correct Answer:B Explanation: CVI exists so that there is a permanent link between a business partner and the customer or vendor tables, such as tables KNA1 and LFA1. Once the SAP S/4HANA system is established, business partner data is saved in the BUT* tables, but if the business partner is extended to the role “customer” then the data will be copied to all the customer master tables, such as tables KNA1 and KNVV. Question When converting from SAP ERP 6.0 to SAP S/4HANA, several steps are required in order to convert customers and vendors to business partners. Which of the following steps are required? (There are two correct answers.) A. Implement CVI in your SAP ERP 6.0 system B. Stop all users from creating customers using Transaction XD01 in your SAP ERP 6.0 system using security authorizations C. Convert existing customers and vendors to business partners in your SAP ERP 6.0 system,D. Create a Legacy System Migration Workbench (LSMW) migration script to convert the customers and vendors in your SAP ERP 6.0 system to business partners in your SAP S/4HANA system,,,AC,
Settlement management in SAP S/4HANA replaces SD rebates. What does this mean for the sales data model?,A. The SD rebate type field has been extended from 1 character to 3 characters.,B. Table VBOX is now redundant.,C. Table VBOX can still be used but must be manually activated. Correct Answer:B Explanation: Within the SD rebates functionality, table VBOX was a real problem for performance, with hundreds of thousands (and in many cases, millions) of data records housed in the table. Due to the power of the SAP HANA database, such index tables are no longer required, and table VBOX is therefore completely redundant in SAP S/4HANA. Question The BRFplus approach to outputs does come with a few limitations. Which of these limitations are true? (There are two correct answers.) A. Only business partners can be used for communication purposes. B. IDocs cannot be used at all by BRFplus. C. ALE is not supported by BRFplus.,D.

True or False: The BRFplus approach to SD output management is mandatory in SAP S/4HANA.,A. True,B. False Correct Answer:B Explanation: False. While it is true that the BRFplus approach to sales and distribution outputs is the default approach in SAP S/4HANA, this functionality can be switched off, meaning that sales and distribution outputs can revert back to the NAST methodology. Question Which of the following are the attributes of BRFplus decision tables? (There are two correct answers.) A. Multiple condition columns are allowed but only one result column. B. Rows in the decision table are read sequentially from top to bottom.,C. When setting up the decision table, each step must be activated before it can be used.,D. Master data value updates in the decision tables in BRFplus must always be transported through the development system to the production landscape.,,,BC,

Customer credit limits can be calculated dynamically or set as a static value.,D. Customer credit limits can be activated by sales document type and/or by item category.,E. By default, customer credit limits are set by the integration with the Credit Rules Engine.,,ACD,
Settlement management has replaced the old SD rebates functionality in SAP S/4HANA, and rebates are now more flexible due to some of these changes. Regarding the difference between sales and materials management condition contracts in SAP S/4HANA, which of the following statements is true?,A. Sales and materials management rebates can now be defined using the same functionality.,B. Materials management rebates must now be defined and maintained in SAP Ariba.,C. Rebates are processed in SAP Fiori and cannot be maintained in SAP GUI. Correct Answer:A Explanation: The beauty of settlement management in SAP S/4HANA is that it harmonizes both sales and materials management functionality in the same area. As a result, condition contracts can be set up in the core system of SAP S/4HANA for customers and vendors alike. SAP Fiori apps are available for creating condition contracts, as are SAP GUI transactions (Transaction WCOCO). Question Where is the data formerly housed in the SAP ERP SD foreign trade functionality now found? A. Smart business embedded analytics apps in SAP Fiori B. SAP GTS C. SAP Analytics Cloud Correct Answer:B Explanation: The old concept of data in the SAP ERP SD foreign trade functionality is obsolete in SAP S/4HANA.
